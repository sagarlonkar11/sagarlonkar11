Hi hope you’re doing well,

I have been a part of Animation/VFX industry for more than 10 years, where I have developed my production and troubleshooting skills working alongside with great colleagues and various interesting projects. Currently working with Weta Digital for more than 5 years. As an Assistant Technical Director, I am mainly responsible to QC/bake all the shots on the show . Alongside with that I have successfully setup multiple assets including biped digi double to prop assets. Have also worked on setup up cloth assets in my past experience. Also got a chance to setup muscles and tissue for production use.

I have completed my Graduate Diploma in Creative Technology in Media Design School, Auckland in 2014. As a part of my final project research, I had taken up practice based research in creation of series of Performance capture tests to understand its design and its workflow.

I am always looking for something which gives me a challenge and provide me with the opportunity to further develop my career in this Industry. I always work with great enthusiasm and with a professional attitude and strive to achieve the optimum results. I believe I would fit well in your company’s team culture and contribute to the ongoing success
